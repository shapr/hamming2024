- back of the envelope calculations
  fermi estimation? I could stand to practice this
- concentrate on fundamentals
- develop the ability to learn new fields of knowledge
- balance learning and contribution
- short term predictions are optimistic, long term predictions are pessimistic
- unforeseen technological innovations can upset the most careful predictions
- no vision, not much future
- predict the future on Friday afternoons
  - what is possible?
  - what is likely?
  - what is desirable?
- a life without struggle on your part to make yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living
  the unexamined life is not worth living
